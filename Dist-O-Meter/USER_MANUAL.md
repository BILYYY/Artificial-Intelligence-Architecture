# Dist-o-Meter — Quick User Manual

## 1. Eye position

* Put your **eye at the drinking end** of the Monster can (like sipping).
* The **grid (1 cm² squares)** is at the cut-off bottom end, facing the target.
* The **angle scale + straw** are at the top near your eye.

---

## 2. Take the measurements

### A) Squares (Grid Method)

1. Pick one dimension of the target you know in real life (height or width).
2. Look through the can at the target.
3. **Count how many grid squares** the target covers along that same direction.

   * Write down this number = **Squares (n)**.
   * Write down the real size of that target part = **S** (cm).
   * Remember your can length = **L** (cm).
4. Put **S, n, square size (1 cm), L** into the app.

---

### B) Angles (Two-Angle Method)

1. Stand at your first spot (A), face straight ahead.
2. Aim the straw at the target and **read the angle** from straight-ahead = **θ₁**.
3. Move sideways by a measured distance = **baseline (b)** cm.
4. From the new spot (B), aim again and **read the angle** = **θ₂**.
5. Put **b, θ₁, θ₂** into the app.

## 3. Get the distance

* The app shows the **grid distance (D\_grid)**, the **angle distance (D\_tri)**, and the **average**.
* Report the average as your best result.
